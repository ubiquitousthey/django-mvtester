            <h1>App Crazy</h1>
            <p>This world is going app crazy.  You've got so many great ideas, but you don't have the time to see them
                through.  With App Crazy, you can start an app project and get others to help.  Push them limits and then share
                the success.</p>

              <h2>Learn</h2>
              <p>Interacting with developers of apps your interested in is a great way to learn about app development.
                  Everyone is short on time, so if you donate some time to a developer, he or she is likely to help you
                  get started.  There is no better way to start developing the next great app than to help someone else first.</p>

            <div class="span5">
              <h2>Earn</h2>
               <p>Once you earn credits on App Crazy through cooperative development, you apply for paid apprenticeships
               with developers.  Paid apprenticeships give you more responsibility and a chance to cash in on the success
               of the app.</p>

              <h2>Burn</h2>
              <p>Once you have been an apprentice, it is time to rachet up your timeline for your own app.  When you have
              earned enough credits, you'll have people applying to help you out.  Multiply your brian power with the
              help of others.</p>
